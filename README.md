# Arson-Detection-Capstone-Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for a multi-functional arson detection system. The system integrates various sensors and technologies to detect and respond to fire incidents effectively. It also analyzes the burn pattern, detects carbon monoxide leaks, and compares the burn pattern with various patterns to determine the accelerant used.

The system captures images of the interior where the fire occurred and of the door to identify potential accelerants and arsonists respectively through a criminal database. This smart system provides information about the identified arsonist, such as their MO, enabling authorities to interview suspects to verify their alibis.

# Installation
To install the Arson Detection System, you will need to have the following components:
ESP32-CAM
MH Fire detection sensor
MQ-7 Carbon monoxide detection sensor
SD card (16GB or higher)
